# BasketballQuickSort
Sorting Basketball stats using text data
This is a simple implementation of quicksort in order to sort individual basketball players stats as retrieved from a text file organized to list data in a set way.  It allows you to enter in command line ways to fetch this, or if wanted, allows you to add "leader" as a command to find the leader in an individual category.  The partition algorithms are separated by the statistic represented while the quicksort is modular to call the partition necessary.
